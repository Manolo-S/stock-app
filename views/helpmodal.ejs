					<p class='helpmodal question'>Q: What can I do with this app?</p>
					<p class='helpmodal'>A: If you type a stock code, e.g. 'FB', in the stock code box and click on 'Add', NYSE stock data will be retrieved with the help of Qandl (https://www.quandl.com/) and displayed in the graph alongside other stocks that were already displayed.</p>
					<p class='helpmodal question'>Q: How can I see what the stock price is at a specific point on the graph?</p>
					<p class='helpmodal'>A: Click on this specific point and a small box will be displayed with the date, stock price and the price percentage change on that day.</p>
					<p class='helpmodal question'>Q: How can I remove a stock from the graph?</p>
					<p class='helpmodal'>A: Click on the 'x' in the box below the graph that contains the stock.</p>
					<p class='helpmodal question'>Q: Why do stocks sometimes appear or disappear without me doing anything?</p>
					<p class='helpmodal'>A: That's because everybody who uses this app sees the same graph. Therefore, if someone else deletes for example the Facebook (FB) stock from their graph it will also be removed through the use of Websockets from the graph on your screen. This feature was added as an excercise to implement Websockets.</p>
